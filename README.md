# CS486-movie-sentiment-analysis
*An agent to be designed to help out with movie selection and ease of choice-making with everything related to movies.*

### Team:
- **Cora Schmidt**
- **Ankit Mukhopadhyay**


## Basic Idea: 
Movie Recommendation Agent. (Experiment with classification of the movies into emotional classification categories)

## Dataset: 
TMDB for movies:.https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US
(We will use more datasets as needed, potentially for reviews of the movies)

## NLP Methods:
Text preprocessing (tokenization), 
TF-IDF for classification (or Naive Bayes/Logistic Regression)
Map like data structure to map words to each review/description/genre of a movie.
Regex (if needed)
Stop Word Removal
Bag of Words
K-means clustering for classification (potential option- maybe, maybe not)?

## AI Agent Implementation:
Model API will be used to call tools specifically, which we will implement. It will not be used to generate any responses on its own.

## Notes:
Weâ€™ll make an API call from the TMDB site. We will get the response as a JSON format, with the description and the title of the movies, and then we will extract the specific information we need, like the description, genre, title, rating etc.

Take data, classify in multiple ways, classification task can determine what kind of movie it is, overview, popularity.
According to the user's interest, have top n movies based on popularity or vote.
IF there is a space complexity problem: remove movies lower than the threshold of popularity.

Given a bunch of movies, get recommendations for closest to similar movies based on that (potential feature) 

## Next Meet (5-11 Oct anytime):
GitHub repo.
Basic json extraction into dataframe using pandas (testing).
